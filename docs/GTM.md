# GTM — EuroYield (Go-To-Launch)

## Positioning (the wedge)
“Euro stablecoin yield discovery and monitoring — clean, compliant-minded, non-custodial.”

Why now:
- MiCA created clearer rules for stablecoins (ART/EMT regime in effect since 30 Jun 2024; broader framework for providers from 30 Dec 2024). This increases demand for “clean” euro stablecoin tooling. 
- Euro stablecoin market is smaller than USD, but showing growth post-MiCA (reports cite ~500M by May 2025 and higher later in 2025).

## ICP (who pays)
Primary:
- DAO treasurers with EUR exposure
- EU family office / crypto treasurers
- DeFi users holding EURC/EURS and comparing yield across protocols
Secondary:
- Developers integrating EUR stablecoins (need exports + API)

## Core offer
Free:
- Yield explorer + calculator (viral hook)
Pro (€19/mo):
- Alerts + watchlist + weekly report personalization
Analyst (€49/mo):
- Wallet insights + history + exports
Institutional:
- On-demand PDF + SLA + custom reporting

## Growth model (product-led)
Your retention engine is not “daily trading.” It’s:
- Alerts (trigger-based returning)
- Weekly report (habit loop)
- Watchlist (personal relevance)
- Calculator (shareable)
