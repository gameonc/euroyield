If you're a European DeFi user, you've probably noticed that most yields are quoted in USD stablecoins like USDC or USDT. But what if you want to avoid currency risk and keep your savings in Euros? That's where Euro stablecoins come in.

## Why Euro Stablecoins Matter

For Europeans, holding USD stablecoins means taking on EUR/USD exchange rate risk. If the Euro strengthens against the Dollar, your USD holdings lose value in Euro terms. Euro stablecoins solve this by maintaining a 1:1 peg with the Euro.

Euro stablecoins let you earn DeFi yields without worrying about EUR/USD exchange rate fluctuations.

## The Big Three Euro Stablecoins

### EURC (Euro Coin by Circle)

  name="Euro Coin"
  issuer="Circle"
  backing="100% Euro-denominated reserves held in regulated financial institutions"
/>

EURC is issued by Circle, the same company behind USDC. It launched in 2022 and has quickly become one of the most trusted Euro stablecoins due to Circle's track record with USDC.

**Key Features:**
- Issued by a regulated US company
- Monthly attestation reports
- Available on Ethereum, Avalanche, and Stellar
- Growing DeFi integrations

### EURS (Stasis Euro)

  name="Stasis Euro"
  issuer="Stasis"
  backing="Euro reserves held in European banks, audited quarterly"
/>

EURS has been around since 2018, making it one of the oldest Euro stablecoins. It's issued by Stasis, a Malta-based company.

**Key Features:**
- Longest track record among Euro stablecoins
- European-regulated issuer
- Strong presence on Curve Finance
- Available on multiple chains

### eEUR (Angle Euro)

<StablecoinCard
  symbol="eEUR"
  name="Angle Euro"
  issuer="Angle Protocol"
  backing="Decentralized collateral including ETH, USDC, and other assets"
/>

eEUR takes a different approach - it's a decentralized, overcollateralized stablecoin created by Angle Protocol.

**Key Features:**
- Fully decentralized (no central issuer)
- Overcollateralized for safety
- Native to DeFi
- Governed by ANGLE token holders

    { protocol: "eEUR", apy: "Decentralized", tvl: "$50M+" }
  ]}

## Where to Earn Yield

Euro stablecoins can earn yield across several DeFi protocols:

1. **Aave** - Lending EURC or EURS
2. **Curve Finance** - Providing liquidity to Euro pools
3. **Compound** - Lending markets (limited Euro support)

<Callout type="warning">
Always research the risks before depositing into any DeFi protocol. Smart contract risk, oracle risk, and liquidity risk are real considerations.
</Callout>

## Which One Should You Choose?

**Choose EURC if:** You prioritize institutional backing and regulatory clarity. Circle's reputation from USDC gives confidence.

**Choose EURS if:** You want an established Euro stablecoin with a long track record and deep Curve liquidity.

**Choose eEUR if:** You prefer decentralization and want a stablecoin without a central issuer.
