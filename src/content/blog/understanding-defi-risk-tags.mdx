One of EuroYield's core features is our risk tagging system. Unlike yield aggregators that only show APY, we believe understanding risk is equally important. Here's how our system works.

## Why Risk Tags Matter

<Callout type="warning">
In DeFi, higher yields almost always mean higher risks. A 20% APY might look attractive until you understand you're exposed to smart contract bugs, oracle manipulation, or liquidity crises.
</Callout>

Our risk tags help you quickly assess:
- How battle-tested is this protocol?
- What's the audit status?
- How concentrated is the risk?
- What could go wrong?

## Our Risk Categories

### Protocol Risk

This measures the inherent risk of the DeFi protocol itself.

| Tag | Meaning | Examples |
|-----|---------|----------|
| **Battle-Tested** | 2+ years live, no major exploits | Aave, Compound, Curve |
| **Established** | 1+ years, minor incidents only | Morpho, Angle |
| **Newer** | Less than 1 year live | Emerging protocols |
| **Experimental** | Novel mechanisms, limited track record | New yield strategies |

<Callout type="info">
Battle-tested doesn't mean risk-free. Even established protocols can have vulnerabilities. It means they've survived longer without major issues.
</Callout>

### Audit Status

Smart contract audits are crucial for security assessment.

| Tag | Meaning |
|-----|---------|
| **Multi-Audit** | Audited by 3+ reputable firms |
| **Audited** | Audited by 1-2 reputable firms |
| **Partial** | Some contracts audited, others pending |
| **Unaudited** | No professional audit completed |

### TVL Tier

Total Value Locked indicates liquidity and trust.

| Tag | TVL Range | Implication |
|-----|-----------|-------------|
| **Whale** | $100M+ | High liquidity, institutional trust |
| **Large** | $10M-$100M | Good liquidity, established presence |
| **Medium** | $1M-$10M | Moderate liquidity |
| **Small** | Under $1M | Lower liquidity, higher slippage risk |

### Asset Risk

This evaluates the underlying stablecoin risk.

| Tag | Meaning |
|-----|---------|
| **Fiat-Backed** | Centralized stablecoin with bank reserves (EURC, EURS) |
| **Crypto-Backed** | Decentralized, collateralized by crypto (eEUR) |
| **Algorithmic** | Maintains peg through algorithms (highest risk) |

## How We Calculate Composite Risk

Each yield opportunity on EuroYield gets a composite risk score:

```
Composite Risk = Protocol Risk + Audit Status + TVL Tier + Asset Risk
```

This gives you an at-a-glance assessment:

<YieldTable
  data={[
    { protocol: "Low Risk", apy: "Green badge", tvl: "Safest options" },
    { protocol: "Medium Risk", apy: "Yellow badge", tvl: "Balanced risk/reward" },
    { protocol: "High Risk", apy: "Red badge", tvl: "Higher yields, higher risk" }
  ]}
/>

## Reading Risk Tags in Practice

Let's look at a real example:

**Aave V3 EURC on Ethereum**
- Protocol: Battle-Tested
- Audit: Multi-Audit (OpenZeppelin, Trail of Bits, others)
- TVL: Whale ($45M+)
- Asset: Fiat-Backed (EURC by Circle)
- **Composite: Low Risk**

**Newer Protocol X with eEUR**
- Protocol: Newer
- Audit: Audited (1 firm)
- TVL: Medium ($5M)
- Asset: Crypto-Backed
- **Composite: Medium-High Risk**

<Callout type="tip">
We recommend starting with Low Risk options if you're new to DeFi. As you gain experience, you can explore higher-risk opportunities for better yields.
</Callout>

## What Risk Tags Don't Cover

Our system has limitations:

1. **Market Risk** - We don't predict price movements
2. **Regulatory Risk** - Future regulation could impact any protocol
3. **Oracle Risk** - Complex to quantify across protocols
4. **Governance Risk** - Protocol changes through governance

<Callout type="warning">
Risk tags are informational tools, not guarantees. Always do your own research and never invest more than you can afford to lose.
</Callout>

## Using Risk Tags for Portfolio Construction

Here's a sample approach to building a Euro yield portfolio:

| Allocation | Risk Level | Example |
|------------|------------|---------|
| 60% | Low Risk | Aave EURC |
| 30% | Medium Risk | Curve 3EUR |
| 10% | Higher Risk | Newer opportunities |

This balances yield optimization with risk management.

## Our Commitment to Transparency

We update risk tags when:
- New audits are completed
- Exploits or incidents occur
- TVL significantly changes
- Protocol upgrades happen

All our risk assessments are based on publicly available information. We don't receive payment from protocols for favorable ratings.
