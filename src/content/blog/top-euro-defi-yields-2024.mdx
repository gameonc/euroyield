Euro yields have been particularly attractive lately due to increased demand for EUR liquidity in DeFi. Let's break down the best options.

## Top 5 Euro Yields

### 1. Aave V3 - EURC Lending

<YieldTable
  data={[
    { protocol: "Aave V3 (Ethereum)", apy: "4.2%", tvl: "$45M" },
    { protocol: "Aave V3 (Arbitrum)", apy: "3.8%", tvl: "$12M" },
    { protocol: "Aave V3 (Optimism)", apy: "3.5%", tvl: "$8M" }
  ]}
/>

Aave remains the gold standard for lending. The EURC market on Ethereum offers the deepest liquidity, while L2 deployments provide lower gas costs.

**Risk Level:** Low-Medium
- Battle-tested smart contracts
- Insurance fund backing
- Established liquidation mechanisms

### 2. Curve Finance - 3EUR Pool

The 3EUR pool combines EURC, EURS, and eEUR for efficient swapping and yield generation.

<YieldTable
  data={[
    { protocol: "Curve 3EUR Pool", apy: "5.1% (base)", tvl: "$28M" },
    { protocol: "+ CRV Rewards", apy: "+2.3%", tvl: "-" },
    { protocol: "Total APY", apy: "7.4%", tvl: "$28M" }
  ]}
/>

**Risk Level:** Medium
- Impermanent loss is minimal (all assets pegged to EUR)
- Smart contract risk across multiple stablecoins
- CRV rewards subject to vesting

<Callout type="tip">
Locking CRV for veCRV can boost your rewards by up to 2.5x. Consider this if you're a long-term holder.
</Callout>

### 3. Morpho Blue - EURC Market

Morpho's peer-to-peer lending optimization layer offers improved rates over base Aave.

<YieldTable
  data={[
    { protocol: "Morpho Blue EURC", apy: "4.8%", tvl: "$15M" }
  ]}
/>

**Risk Level:** Medium
- Additional smart contract layer on top of Aave
- Newer protocol with shorter track record
- Growing institutional adoption

### 4. Angle Protocol - eEUR Savings

Angle's native savings rate for eEUR provides a simple yield option.

<YieldTable
  data={[
    { protocol: "Angle Savings", apy: "3.9%", tvl: "$22M" }
  ]}
/>

**Risk Level:** Medium
- Native yield from protocol revenue
- Decentralized governance
- No additional smart contract risk beyond eEUR itself

### 5. Compound V3 - EURS

Compound's V3 architecture brings Euro support with isolated risk.

<YieldTable
  data={[
    { protocol: "Compound V3 EURS", apy: "3.5%", tvl: "$8M" }
  ]}
/>

**Risk Level:** Low-Medium
- Battle-tested protocol
- Isolated market design
- Lower TVL means potentially less liquidity

## Risk-Adjusted Analysis

When choosing where to deposit, consider:

1. **Smart Contract Risk** - Older protocols like Aave and Compound have more audits and battle-testing
2. **Liquidity Risk** - Higher TVL generally means easier exits
3. **Counterparty Risk** - Centralized stablecoins (EURC, EURS) have issuer risk; decentralized (eEUR) has collateral risk
4. **Yield Sustainability** - Token rewards may decrease over time

<Callout type="warning">
Higher yields often come with higher risks. Never deposit more than you can afford to lose, and always diversify across protocols.
</Callout>

## Our Picks

**For Conservative Investors:** Aave V3 EURC on Ethereum offers the best balance of yield and safety.

**For Yield Maximizers:** Curve 3EUR pool with CRV staking provides the highest sustainable APY.

**For DeFi Natives:** Morpho Blue offers alpha through lending optimization.
